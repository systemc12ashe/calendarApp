# Palendar 
The Palendar, is an online web application that automatically generates a calendar by allowing people to input their calendar events with their scheduling preferences all with the help of their little Pal. Users are able to input each event alongside the name of the event, the time of the event, the duration of the event, and the calendar will be generated upon those requirements.
